# Operators and Control Flow Lab

This repository contains a Python lab exercise designed to practice **operators** and **control flow statements** in Python. The lab covers arithmetic operations, comparison operators, logical operators, and decision-making using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

The code is structured to align with typical CodeGrade labs and includes examples of common scenarios to demonstrate proper use of Python operators and control flow.
